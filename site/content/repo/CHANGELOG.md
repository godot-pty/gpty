### Added

- Multi-PTY terminal emulator with tiling grid GUI
- `godopty-core` library: PTY spawning (`portable-pty`), ANSI parsing (`vte`), terminal grid (`alacritty_terminal`), concept pub-sub engine
- `godopty-gdext` GDExtension: `GodoptyTerminal` GodotClass with damage-tracked grid rendering
- `godopty-cli` binary: mock, `--pty`, and `--term` demo modes
- Tiling grid: split vertically/horizontally, kill, expand, and nested `SplitContainer` layout
- Pane types: terminal, code viewer (`CodeEdit`), file tree (`Tree`), observer
- Concept engine: regex triggers → labelled actions with `{payload}`/`{N}` variable substitution
- Concept capture: `UntilStop` mode buffers command output and routes to receiver panes with bidirectional handshake; prompt restoration on acknowledge
- Default concepts shipped (`concepts.default.json`) with enable/disable toggle and deep-merge migration from user overrides
- Settings persistence: cursor shape/blink/thickness, scroll sensitivity, default dimensions, font family/size, UI theme colors, color palette schemes — all auto-saved to `user://settings.json`
- Profile manager: named layout snapshots saved to `user://profiles.json`
- Layout auto-save/restore via `user://layout.json`
- Scrollback with `scroll_up`/`scroll_down`, scrollback indicator, and `Ctrl+F` regex search
- Wrapped text selection for copy/paste
- Toast notification system (info, warn, error) with replace-on-new behavior
- Centralized icon system (`icons.gd`) using Phosphor icon font
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+N` (spawn), `Ctrl+W` (close), `Ctrl+B` (sidebar), `Ctrl+P` (command palette), `Ctrl+Shift+R` (reset)
- `Alt+Arrow` geographic pane focus navigation
- Sidebar: pane list with focus, minimize/maximize, swap, kill, and profile save/load
- Command palette with fuzzy command matching
- Title bar per pane with label prefix and action buttons
- Scrollback history stored in SQLite
- Standalone export presets (Linux, macOS, Windows) with CI release workflow
- 60 Rust tests (core + integration) and 40+ GDScript unit/integration tests
